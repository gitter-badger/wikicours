Wikicours is an online repository of school lessons that anyone can improve through a wiki ✏️📚

You can see it as a “Wikipedia of school lessons”, all the content is under free license 🆓🎓

For now at least, it is only in French and built for the French school programs, but you contribute to the project even if you don't speak French! 🇫🇷🌍

The topics targeted are those covered by the official school curriculum, for all classes in middle school and school (French collège and lycée). 🏫

> To know more, you can read the article explaining the goals of the project and the idea behind it: 👀 http://medium.com/@thomaskuntz/wikifying-educational-resources-84a6daf9d234

The name could translate to Wikicourse in English.

## Contributing 👋🤝

⚠️ As of now, we mainly need help in three areas:

* 📚 __Lessons to publish__: We're actively looking for people willing to contribute learning material to the project. We need: courses, exercises and test subjects with worked-out answers, methodology sheets, revision sheets, or really _anything that can be useful for French students at the collège (middle school) and lycée (high school) level_.
* 🎨 __Design__: The design we have right now is extremely bare-bones and not really attractive. We would love to see suggestions for a new design or for improving what we have now. We have also no branding for the project yet, so we would love to see suggestions too!
* 💻 __Website development__: The website is only at the prototype stage. Any help for implementing a better design, adding some features or sections, improving the content (e.g the homepage), making some tweaks or anything else is very welcome!

And if you have any other idea, suggestion, or feedback I'd love to hear from you! 💡 You can find us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Wikicours) or reach out via [e-mail](mailto:admin@wikicours.org). 🗣
